# Autodiff
I want to learn autograd the right way<br>
This is a reimplementation/decoding based on [the full version of Autograd](https://github.com/hips/autograd).

## The goal:
To dive into Matthew Johnson autograd package, understand it the best I can, document, and reimplement.

## Rescores:
[The video slides by Matthew](http://videolectures.net/deeplearning2017_johnson_automatic_differentiation/)<br>
[the full version of Autograd](https://github.com/hips/autograd)<br>
[tutorial implementation ](https://github.com/mattjj/autodidact)<br>
